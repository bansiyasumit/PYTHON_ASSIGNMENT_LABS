## 🎯 Objective

This repository contains programs completed as part of the Python Programming Laboratory.
The aim is to build strong foundations in:

* Python syntax & variables
* Operators and expressions
* Conditional statements and loops
* Functions & recursion
* Data structures (Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries)
* File handling
* OOP concepts
* Modules & packages
* String operations
* Error handling

Each experiment is implemented with simple example programs and descriptive outputs.

## 📂 Repository Contents (Experiments)

### **1. Basic Setup & Data Types**

* Display different data types (int, float, string, bool, list, tuple, dict, None)
* String concatenation using `+=`
* String addition and multiplication

### **2. Operator-Based Programs**

* Area of triangle using **Heron’s Formula**
* Piggy bank total using arithmetic operators

### **3. Number System & Conversions**

* Decimal → Binary, Octal, Hex using `bin()`, `oct()`, `hex()`
* Convert string to float and add 10.5

### **4. Operator Precedence, Conditionals & Loops**

* Manual breakdown of `10 + 2 * 3 ** 2 - 8 / 4`
* Dictionary lookup using user input
* Reverse a number
* Multiplication table

### **5. Nested Loops & Keyword Arguments**

* Numeric pattern printing
* Multiplication table using loop
* Keyword argument function `student_info()`
* Absolute value, square root, cube

### **6. Functions & Recursion**

* Lambda function for squaring
* Recursive digit count
* List input and reverse traversal

### **7. Modules & Packages**

* Using `random` with alias
* Simple line plot using `matplotlib.pyplot`

### **8. String Operations**

* Remove vowels from a string
* Palindrome check ignoring case & non-alphanumeric

### *(Further experiments can be added similarly when you upload more code)*

# Python Practicals Lab Exam – File Handling, Functions, and Patterns

This repository contains Python programs written as part of a programming assignment.  
The programs focus on file handling, conditional logic, and pattern generation using basic Python concepts.

---

## 📌 Programs Included

### 1. Safe Update of Student Fees (File Handling)
- Updates student fee records stored in a file.
- Uses a **temporary file** to ensure data safety.
- If an error occurs, the original file remains unchanged.
- Error reasons are logged into a separate log file.

**Concepts Used:**
- File handling
- Exception handling
- Temporary file and rename strategy
- Logging errors

---

### 2. Leap Year Checker Function
- Checks whether a given year is a leap year or not.
- Uses a function for modular and reusable code.
- Displays an appropriate message based on leap year rules.

**Concepts Used:**
- Functions
- Conditional statements
- Arithmetic operators

---

### 3. Pattern Generation with Cross and Diagonals
- Accepts an odd integer `n`.
- Generates a symmetric pattern containing:
  - Vertical cross
  - Horizontal cross
  - Both main diagonals
- All lines intersect at the center.

**Concepts Used:**
- Nested loops
- Conditional logic
- Pattern printing
