## 📌 Programs Included

### 1. Safe Update of Student Fees (File Handling)
- Updates student fee records stored in a file.
- Uses a **temporary file** to ensure data safety.
- If an error occurs, the original file remains unchanged.
- Error reasons are logged into a separate log file.

**Concepts Used:**
- File handling
- Exception handling
- Temporary file and rename strategy
- Logging errors

### 2. Leap Year Checker Function
- Checks whether a given year is a leap year or not.
- Uses a function for modular and reusable code.
- Displays an appropriate message based on leap year rules.

**Concepts Used:**
- Functions
- Conditional statements
- Arithmetic operators

### 3. Pattern Generation with Cross and Diagonals
- Accepts an odd integer `n`.
- Generates a symmetric pattern containing:
  - Vertical cross
  - Horizontal cross
  - Both main diagonals
- All lines intersect at the center.

**Concepts Used:**
- Nested loops
- Conditional logic
- Pattern printing
